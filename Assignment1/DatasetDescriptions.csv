Alejandro de la Cruz López; acrulopez; Manually curated transcriptomics data collection for toxicogenomic assessment of engineered nanomaterials; https://zenodo.org/record/5744003#.YyRNTexBw-Q; Toxicogenomics (TGx) approaches are increasingly applied to gain insight into the possible toxicity mechanisms of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). Omics data can be valuable to elucidate the mechanism of action of chemicals and develop predictive models in toxicology. While vast amounts of transcriptomics data from ENM exposures have already been accumulated, a unified, easily accessible and reusable collection of transcriptomics data for ENMs is currently lacking. In an attempt to improve the FAIRness of already existing transcriptomics data for nanomaterials, we curated a collection of homogenized transcriptomics data from human, mouse and rat ENM exposures in vitro and in vivo.
